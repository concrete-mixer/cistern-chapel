- Get oneshot scheduling working. This involves:
    - having just one Tone.Transport.scheduleRepeat() (only one seems to be supported at a time, or at least, the last one called seems to be the only one running).
    - implement a concurrency limit for oneshot buffers. Maybe two for instruments (sometimes nice to have collisions) and one for concrete?
    - Proposed lifecycle:
        - Next time oneShotChoice() called, as part of determining if we should do something, check if all players are currently in use (if so, we'd do nothing)
        - If there's a player free, and we've decided to play a new oneshot, pick a buffer, get its duration, store the transport time we'd expect it to be done by, for future checking.
- Freeverb seemed to be affecting performance. Try again after buffer rework
