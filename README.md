# The Cistern Chapel

A sound-art project one page app built with tonejs + typescript + webpack + a tiny bit of React. The chief interest for github perusers will probably be the projects use of [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) to arbitrarily sequence audio from mp3 field recordings to produce a drifting soundscape of dribbles and brass instrument parping. It sounds better than that description would indicate.
